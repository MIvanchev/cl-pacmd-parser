## cl-pacmd-parser â€“ a parser for pacmd's various listings

I've written this library for my [StumpWM](https://github.com/stumpwm/stumpwm)
setup. It's quick and dirty and NOT good (but it works).

Currently supports parsing the output of `pacmd list-sources` and
`pacmd list-sinks`. Contributions always welcome.
